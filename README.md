# German Vocabulary Learner

A nice little personal vocabulary builder for myself, written mostly with Svelte and SvelteKit.

This app is currently in development. Most functionalities are incomplete. The README file will be updated accordingly if any huge update happens.

## List of core functions:

- Nouns with Articles
- Verb Forms
- Other Vocabularies
- Grammar Rules

## Nouns with Articles

Start building your dictionary from here. You can record the gender articles, plural forms, and the english translation of every noun. Your vocabularies will be recorded in `localStorage` provided by the browsers.

I am currently following the German textbook studio[express], so all pages order vocabularies by their chapters. Choosing no chapters for a vocabulary will place it at the top.

## Expanding ideas

- Verb forms
- Grammar rules (photo upload)
- Quizzes
